## building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opsgang/docker_aws_terraform.git
cd docker_aws_terraform
git clone https://github.com/opsgang/alpine_build_scripts
./build.sh # adds custom labels to image
```

## installing

```bash
docker pull opsgang/aws_terraform:stable # or use the tag you prefer
```

## running

```bash
# To use terraform >0.10.0 with preinstalled aws and/or fastly provisioners:
#
# Mount your terraform dir and set env var TERRAFORM_WORKING_DIRECTORY to mount path.
#
docker run -i --rm \
    -v /path/to/my_tf_dir:/workspace \
    -e TERRAFORM_WORKING_DIRECTORY=/workspace \
        opsgang/aws_terraform:stable <some cmds to run>
```

```bash
# To use a version of terraform not built in to an available opsgang container:
#
# Set env var TERRAFORM_VERSION, and the container will install and use this version.
# e.g. to use 0.9.8
#
docker run --rm -e TERRAFORM_VERSION=0.9.8 -i opsgang/aws_terraform:stable <some cmds to run>
```

```bash
# To run /path/to/script.sh which calls terraform, aws cli, curl, jq blah ...
docker run --rm -i -v /path/to/script.sh:/script.sh:ro opsgang/aws_terraform:stable /script.sh
```

```bash
# To make my aws creds available and run /some/python/script.py
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="i'll-never-tell" # replace glibness with your access key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="that's-for-me-to-know" # amend as necessary

docker run --rm -i                      \ # ... run interactive to see stdout / stderr
    -v /some/python/script.py:/my.py:ro \ # ... assume the file is executable
    --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID             \ # ... will read it from your env
    --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY         \ # ... will read it from your env
    --env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-2  \ # ... adjust geography to taste
    opsgang/aws_terraform:stable /my.py      # script can access these env vars
```

```bash
# let me treat the container like a dev workspace and try stuff out.
# Oh look! vim is preinstalled. How cool! And gratuitous.
docker run -it opsgang/aws_terraform:stable /bin/bash
```
